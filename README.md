This python flask code represents a working example of a python code project that allows the user to create a new assistant, query the new assistant, and delete the new assistant.  The HTML is very clean, the prompt for instructions should always be " you are a helpful assistant, your are an expert (your choice)",  the model that works the best is gpt-4o. this assumes you have an openai api account and api key for your account stored as an environment variable,  this was developed on a Macbook M3, using pycharm professional IDE, this code also works in a docker container and and as a cloud code run deploy for google cloud server.    email me at sbayer2@gmail.com if you have questions or improvements
